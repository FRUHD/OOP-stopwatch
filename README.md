# Stopwatch
<p>Stopwatch exercise from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk" target="_blank">Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript: Made Super Simple</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA" target="_blank">Programming with Mosh</a>.</p>
<p>Originally did the exercise on March 27, 2022, and it was uploaded to my <a href="https://github.com/FRUHD/100Devs" target="_blank">100Devs</a> homeworx repo, but now it's here in its own.
